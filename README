README for spill
================

Spill (Simple Python Implementation of Lisp) is a small lisp-like language.

Its purpose is:

1. to help me understand how Lisp works and how to implement it.

2. to serve as example code for building ShowMe. Possibly the ShowMe code
will be based on Spill.

3. to serve as a testbed for implementing other language features, e.g.
compiliation into Python, macros, etc.
